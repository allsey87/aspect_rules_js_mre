This repo reproduces https://github.com/aspect-build/rules_js/issues/2190 which comes up when a custom rule is used to generate a single Javascript file that needs to be tested. For example, assume in the following BUILD file that `custom_rule` with name `output` returns a `DefaultInfo` provider with a single file `output.js`.

```starlark
load("@aspect_rules_js//js:defs.bzl", "js_test")
load("//:custom_rule.bzl", "custom_rule")

custom_rule(
    name = "output",
)

js_test(
    name = "validate",
    entry_point = "output.js",
    data = [":output"],
    timeout = "short",
)
```

If data is omitted, we get an error:
> Copying file output.js failed: missing input file '//:output.js'

If data is provided, we get the error:
> file 'output.js' is generated by these conflicting actions:
Label: //:output, //:validate

For now, the only workaround (that I know of) is to create a custom wrapper that launches output.js:
```starlark
load("@aspect_rules_js//js:defs.bzl", "js_test")
load("@bazel_skylib//rules:write_file.bzl", "write_file")
load("//:custom_rule.bzl", "custom_rule")

custom_rule(
    name = "output",
)

write_file(
    name = "wrapper",
    out = "wrapper.js",
    content = [
        "require('./output.js')"
    ]
)

js_test(
    name = "validate",
    entry_point = "wrapper.js",
    data = [":output"],
    timeout = "short",
)
```
